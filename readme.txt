Enables save-for-later functionality, boosting customer retention and encouraging site revisits.

== Description ==

There are times when customers need to save products for future consideration when they decide that they won’t need them for their current order yet. It’s impossible to save products when they are already added to the cart? Well, it’s possible with **WPC Save for Later**.

**WPC Save for Later for WooCommerce** will add a little but powerful button under each item on the cart page that allows buyers to save products for later with ease. These items will appear on the Saved for Later list right under the main items on the cart so that customers won’t forget to include them in their next order. Moving a product from the cart to the Save for Later list or vice versa only takes 1 click.
